## Setup
Create a `.env` file in `cmd/server`. The values here are the same as the [Lounge Hub](https://github.com/ubcesports/lounge-hub). Ask your directors for the values. 

To start the app, cd into `cmd/server` and run `go run .`. 

To check that the server is working, you can run a health ping by through the `/health` endpoint.
